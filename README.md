This is a collection of Perl scripts for making and examining Blorb files.  

Blorb is a format for storing resources associated with an interactive 
fiction game.  Resources can be things such as sounds, pictures, and 
executables.  This is a convenient way to package a game and all its 
resources together in one file.

The Blorb format was created by Andrew Plotkin in 1998.
